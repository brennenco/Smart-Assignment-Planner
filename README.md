## current Contributions
- UI Prototype Redesign: modern, user-friendly interface mockups
- Database Design: developed a clean and efficient EER diagram
- Full-stack Development: (in active development)planning and implementation for online functionality
- Code Refactoring: (in active development)progressively updating legacy class code to professional standards

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: (in active development)
- **Backend:** (in active development) Java  
- **Database:** (in active development) MySQL
- **Tools:** GitHub, Eclipse/IDE, Drawio (for diagrams)

## Current State
- UI prototypes and EER diagrams are complete
- Original class code is included for reference
- Full online version is under development

## Future Improvements
- Complete backend implementation
- User authentication and session management
- Task prioritization and notifications
- Improved UI/UX with responsive design

## Skills Demonstrated
- project management
- UI/UX design
- Database modeling (EER)
- Java programming and code refactoring
- Problem-solving in full-stack development
